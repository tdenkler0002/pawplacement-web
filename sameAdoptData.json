My previous owner let staff know that I seem to be more comfortable with women than men and I've also lived with kids! I am very outgoing, loving, and playful. I lived in a home with cats and dogs but need to be the only pet in my new home. As soon as you meet me, you'll realize I can provide all the love and happiness that you'll need from a pet!<p></p><p></p>I am a very smart dog! I have shown my caregivers that I already know how to &quot;sit&quot;. I am eager to learn more with you!<p></p><p></p>I am an affectionate lovebug who would be thrilled to cuddle up with you at home!<p></p><p></p>I am full of energy and I love to play! I tend to calm down more when the people around me stay calm. I do best when I have lots of exercise and something to keep my mind busy.<p></p><p></p>My caregivers have observed that I do not get along with other pets in a home. <p></p><p></p>My personality color is GREEN. I am an adaptable cat who loves to go with the flow! I am outgoing and carefree, and I just can't wait to find my forever home!<p></p> Adoption Fee: $100.00<p></p>"

I am a 10 year old lady who came to the shelter because my previous owner had to move and could not take me along.  If you love black kitties and you are looking for a calm influence, I could be the one for you.<p></p><p></p>I am slightly reserved but appreciate the attention you give me and like to have you pet my head.  I would do best in a home with no small children as I can be just a little bit shy.

My name is Thor and I am available for adoption.<p></p><p></p>I was brought in by my previous owner on April 28, 2018 because they could not keep me. My previous owner described me as playful, timid, and protective. I lived in a home with cats but my owner said I was always too excited and very loud around other animals. I also lived with an older child but my caregivers feel I should be around dog savvy children only because I can be nervous with handling.<p></p><p></p>I am a super handsome dog. The best part of my looks is my overbite, which makes me look a little like a parrot. It is super cute and unique!<p></p><p></p>I am a very smart dog! I have shown my caregivers that I already know how to &quot;sit&quot;, &quot;stay&quot;, &quot;come&quot;, &quot;down&quot; and &quot;shake&quot;.<p></p><p></p>I am an independent dog who likes to do my own thing!<p></p><p></p>I am full of energy and I love to play! I tend to calm down more when the people around me stay calm. I do best when I have lots of exercise and something to keep my mind busy.<p></p><p></p>My caregivers have observed that I might not get along with other dogs. I may do best as the only dog in my new home, or need to meet other dogs in the home first.<p></p><p></p>Because of my shy nature, I would do best in a calm, quiet home with older children.<p></p><p></p>My personality color is RED. I am a spirited dog with a fun-loving personality! I am still working on my manners, so I would do best with a family who is willing to work with me and help me become the best dog I can be!<p></p> Adoption Fee: $225.00<p></p>"

She is an 11-year-old adoptable cat currently living in a foster home. Unlike most fosters she's not in care because of her age or her health, but because of her attitude. When she first came to the shelter she was hissy and snarly and very difficult to manage. Ordinarily a cat that unfriendly to humans would be put up for adoption as a barn cat, but Gertie is front declawed and would never be able to defend herself outdoors. Her only hope was to get away from the stress of the shelter environment to see if some loving care could bring her back to the light side.<p></p><p></p>After months in foster care Gertie is a changed cat. Granted, she's still something of a curmudgeon and has definite opinions about how things ought to be, but she enjoys petting and brushing, and has a rumbling purr that she's happy to share. She is more than ready to go to her forever home, ideally where she can rule over her own private space. Gertie needs an adopter who is willing to learn her signals and respect her limits, and who appreciates that winning the heart of a &quot;difficult&quot; animal is well worth the patience it will require. Please contact Melodye Johnson - melodyej63@msn.com or (253)740-0269 (ok to text)<p></p>Adoption Fee: $30.00<p></p>"

My name is Django and I am available for adoption.<p></p><p></p>I was brought in by my previous owner on March 20, 2018 because I was not the best fit for a rambunctious, high traffic home. My previous owner described me as outgoing, loving, playful and pretty much the best dog ever.<p></p><p></p>I love my people and want to be around them, cuddling and helping out with whatever tasks need to get done for the day!<p></p><p></p>I am full of energy and I love to play! I tend to calm down more when the people around me stay calm. I do best when I have lots of exercise and something to keep my mind busy.<p></p><p></p>My caregivers have noticed that I seem to do well with other large dogs, but can be reactive to some dogs when we meet behind a fence. I would do best meeting any potential dog friends at the shelter before going home. When meeting dogs in a new home, I would do best with a slow introduction.<p></p><p></p>I would do best in a quiet, low traffic adult only home. My previous owners let staff know that loud noises and lots of commotion makes me very uneasy and does not always bring out my best side. However, while in the shelter, I have done great with the positive and gentle approach that my caregivers have taken.<p></p><p></p>My personality color is RED. I am a spirited dog with a fun-loving personality! I am still working on my manners, so I would do best with a family who is willing to work with me and help me become the best dog I can be!<p></p> Adoption Fee: $100.00<p></p>"

My name is Lila Rose and I am available for adoption.<p></p><p></p>I was brought in by my previous owner on April 2, 2018 because I was not a good fit for their home.<p></p><p></p>I am a beautiful cat that appreciates time to get used to my surroundings and my people. Once I warm up to you, I am an affectionate lovebug who loves to meow and talk to you! <p></p><p></p>I like getting attention on my own terms. I can get overstimulated with petting, so please move carefully with me and keep an eye out for signs that I might need a break.<p></p><p></p>Because of my shy nature, I would do best in a low traffic adult only home.<p></p><p></p>My personality color is RED. I am a spirited cat with a fun-loving personality! I may be sensitive to handling, so I would do best in a home with a cat savvy family who knows when to give me some space.<p></p> Adoption Fee: $30.00<p></p>"
